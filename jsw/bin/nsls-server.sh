# Wrapper will start the JVM asynchronously. Your application may have some
#  initialization tasks and it may be desirable to wait a few seconds
#  before returning.  For example, to delay the invocation of following
#  startup scripts.  Setting WAIT_AFTER_STARTUP to a positive number will
#  cause the start command to delay for the indicated period of time 
#  (in seconds).

WAIT_AFTER_STARTUP=0

# If set, the status, start_msg and stop_msg commands will print out detailed
#   state information on the Wrapper and Java processes.

# If specified, the Wrapper will be run as the specified user.
# IMPORTANT - Make sure that the user has the required privileges to write
#  the PID file and wrapper.log files.  Failure to be able to write the log
#  file will cause the Wrapper to exit without any way to write out an error
#  message.
# NOTE - This will set the user which is used to run the Wrapper as well as
#  the JVM and is not useful in situations where a privileged resource or
#  port needs to be allocated prior to the user being changed.

# The following two lines are used by the chkconfig command. Change as is
