1. Java Service Wrapper, nsls-server.conf

wrapper.app.parameter.3
The limit on how many log events will be kept before the oldest events are
discarded.  This may be specified as a time interval or by disk usage.  The
syntax for a time interval is a count followed 'm' (minutes), 'h' (hours),
or 'd' (days).  For example, 72h is 72 hours.  The syntax for limiting by
disk usage is a count following by 'kb' (kilobytes), 'mb' (megabytes), or
'gb' (gigabytes).  For example, 10mb is 10 megabytes.

wrapper.app.parameter.4
The port number that the NSLS Server listens on for connections from clients
(eg. clients wishing to log events or the NSLS Console).

wrapper.app.parameter.5
The path of a directory which will contain the NSLS log files (and only
NSLS log files).  The path can either be absolute or relative to the NSLS
installation (the "nsls" directory).
