NSLS INSTALLATION
-----------------


Install Java (if not already installed)
---------------------------------------

If you plan to rebuild the NSLS distribution, install the Java Development
Kit (JDK).  Otherwise, only the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) needs to be
installed.  Both are available at java.sun.com.  The most recent release is
preferred with V1.5.0 as a minimum.



Make sure that Java applications can be executed
------------------------------------------------

The "bin" directory of the JRE (or SDK) must be added to the beginning of the
PATH environment variable so the "java" executable can be executed (and the
"javac" and "javadoc" executables if you're going to rebuild).  Ensuring that
the "bin" directory is at the beginning of the PATH environment variable
prevents some other Java distribution from being used (such as the Java that
ships with some operating systems).



Copy the NSLS distribution to the desired location
--------------------------------------------------

The "nsls-<version>.zip" file (where <version> is the version number)
contains, at the top-level, a directory named "nsls".  In the desired
directory  (typically "drl") copy "nsls-<version>.zip" and enter
"unzip nsls-<version>.zip".  This will create the "nsls" directory in that
directory.  All directory paths referred to in these instructions are
relative to the "nsls" directory.

Configure the NSLS Server and the Java Service Wrapper
------------------------------------------------------

The NSLS Server is run as a service using the Java Service Wrapper.  The
Java Service Wrapper is configured by editing "./jsw/conf/nsls-server.conf"
as described in "docs/configs-format.txt".

Also, depending on whether a 32-bit or 64-bit operating system is being used,
use

  ./config-jsw.sh 32

or

  ./config-jsw.sh 64

respectively, to further configure the Java Service Wrapper (JSW) for the
computer architecture.



Start the NSLS Server automatically at boot (if desired)
--------------------------------------------------------

The NSLS Server can be started at boot.  In /etc/rc.local add:

su - <user> -c "<path>/jsw/bin/nsls-server.sh start"

where <user> is the user the NSLS Server will run as and <path> is the
absolute path of the "nsls" directory.  Don't run the NSLS Server as "root".



Start the NSLS Server manually (if desired)
-------------------------------------------

The NSLS Server can be started, restarted, or stopped at any time
from a shell by entering "<path>/jsw/bin/nsls-server.sh <cmd>" where <path>
is the absolute path of the NISGS installation directory and <cmd> is "start",
"restart", or "stop" (without the double-quotes).  This must be done as the
same user that originally started the NSLS Server.



Troubleshooting
---------------

Log files for the Java Service Wrapper are in "./jsw/logs".  They should
be examined if the NSLS Server doesn't appear to be running.



Rebuilding.

If you find it necessary to rebuild the NSLS distribution use

  ./build.sh
  
to compile the Java source files and create the "nsls.jar" file in the "lib"
directory.  Then use

  ./build_javadoc.sh
  
to create the javadoc documentation in the "javadoc" directory.



Create launcher
---------------

Optionally, create a desktop launcher to run the NSLS Console.  The creation
of launchers varies between the different flavors of Linux and their desktop
environments.  In all cases the command line described below to execute the
NSLS Console will apply.



Execute the NSLS Console
------------------------

Double-click the NSLS Console launcher.  Or, if a launcher isn't being
used, while in the "nsls" directory enter

  ./bin/nsls-console.sh

followed by any command line arguments as described in
"console-users-guide.txt".
