NSLS INSTALLATION
-----------------


Install Java (if not already installed)
---------------------------------------

If you plan to rebuild the NSLS distribution, install the Java Development
Kit (JDK).  Otherwise, only the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) needs to be
installed.  Both are available at java.sun.com.  The most recent release is
preferred with V1.5.0 as a minimum.



Make sure that Java applications can be executed
------------------------------------------------

The "java" executable will have been installed in "C:\WINDOWS\system32"
(on XP systems).  If a different "java" executable is to be used, the "bin"
directory of its JRE (or JDK) must be added to the beginning of the PATH
environment variable (ie. before "C:\WINDOWS\system32").  If you plan to
rebuild the NSLS distribution, the "bin" directory of the JDK must be added
to the beginning to the PATH environment variable so that the "javac" and
"javadoc" executables can be executed.



Copy the NSLS distribution to the desired location
--------------------------------------------------

The "nsls-<version>.zip" file (where <version> is the version number)
contains, at the top-level, a directory named "nsls".  Extract/copy the "nsls"
directory to the desired location (typically a directory named "drl" perhaps
in "C:\Program Files").  All directory paths referred to in these instructions
are relative to the "nsls" directory.

Configure the NSLS Server and the Java Service Wrapper
------------------------------------------------------

The NSLS Server is run as a service using the Java Service
Wrapper.  The Java Service Wrapper is configured by editing
".\jsw-Windows\conf\nsls-server.conf" as described in
".\docs\configs-format.txt".



Install the NSLS Server as a Windows service
--------------------------------------------

In the ".\jsw-Windows\bin" directory, double-click "InstallNSLSServer-NT.bat".
This will install the NSLS Server to be started automatically when
Windows boots.  To modify how the NSLS Server is installed, use the
"Services" windows found at "Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services".
It will now contain a service named "NSLS Server".  Using the "Service"
window, the Simulcast Services can be started/stopped.  Whether or not the
Simulcast Services automatically start at boot can also be specified.

To uninstall the NSLS Server, first stop the NSLS Server and then
double-click "UninstallNSLSServer-NT.bat" in the ".\jsw-Windows\bin" directory.



Troubleshooting
---------------

Log files for the Java Service Wrapper are in "./jsw-Windows/logs".  They
should be examined if the NSLS Server doesn't appear to be running.



Rebuilding
----------

If you find it necessary to rebuild the NSLS distribution use

  .\build.bat
  
to compile the Java source files and create the "nsls.jar" file in the "lib"
directory.  Then use

  .\build_javadoc.bat
  
to create the javadoc documentation in the "javadoc" directory.



Create shortcut
---------------

Optionally, create a shortcut to run the NSLS Console.

a) In the ".\bin" directory, right-click the "nsls-console.bat" file and
   select "Create Shortcut".
b) Move the shortcut to the desired location (eg. the Desktop).
c) Rename the shortcut "NSLS Console".
d) Right-click the shortcut and select "Properties".  Command line arguments
   can be added at the end of the "Target:" field if desired (after the
   absolute path for console.bat).  They are described in
   "client-arguments.txt".  Modify the "Start in:" field to be the absolute
   path of the "nsls" directory.  Change the "Run:" selection to "Minimized".



Execute the NSLS Console
------------------------

Double-click the NSLS Console shortcut.  Or, if a shortcut isn't being
used, while in the "nsls" directory enter

  .\bin\nsls-console.sh

followed by any command line arguments as described in
"console-users-guide.txt".
